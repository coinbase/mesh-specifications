        When requesting a block by the hash component of the BlockIdentifier,

        hash-identified block must return the exact same block contents.

        No such restriction is imposed when requesting a block by height,
        given that a chain reorg event might cause the specific block at
        height `n` to be set to a different one.

        Get a transaction in a block by its Transaction Identifier. This endpoint
        should only be used when querying a node for a block does not return all
        transactions contained within it.

        All transactions returned by this endpoint must be appended to any
        transactions returned by the /block method by consumers of this data.
        Fetching a transaction by hash is considered an Explorer Method
        (which is classified under the Future Work section).

        This method can be used to let consumers to paginate results when the 
        block trasactions count is too big to be returned in a single BlockResponse.

        Calling this endpoint requires reference to a BlockIdentifier because
        transaction parsing can change depending on which block contains the
        transaction. For example, in Bitcoin it is necessary to know which block
        contains a transaction to determine the destination of fee payments.
        Without specifying a block identifier, the node
        would have to infer which block to use (which could change during a re-org).

        Implementations that require fetching previous transactions to populate
        the response (ex: Previous UTXOs in Bitcoin) may find it useful to run a
        cache within the Rosetta server in the /data directory
        (on a path that does not conflict with the node).

        Get a transaction in the mempool by its Transaction Identifier. This is

        because some blockchain nodes need to know that a transaction query is

        Transactions may not be fully parsable until they are in a block (ex: may
        not be possible to determine the fee to pay before a transaction is
        executed). On this endpoint, it is ok that returned transactions are

        Get an array of all AccountBalances for an AccountIdentifier and the

        to know specifically at which block the balance was calculated to
        compare balances they compute from operations with the balance returned
        by the node.

        It is important to note that making a balance request for an account
        without populating the SubAccountIdentifier should not result in the
        balance of all possible SubAccountIdentifiers being returned. Rather,
        it should result in the balance pertaining to no SubAccountIdentifiers
        being returned (sometimes called the liquid balance). To get all
        balances associated with an account, it may be necessary to
        perform multiple balance requests with unique AccountIdentifiers.

        It is also possible to perform a historical balance lookup (if the server
        supports it) by passing in an optional BlockIdentifier.

        Get an array of all unspent coins for an AccountIdentifier and the

        does not support coins (i.e. it is for an account-based blockchain),
        you do not need to implement this endpoint. If you implementation does
        support coins (i.e. it is fro a UTXO-based blockchain), you MUST
        also complete the `/account/balance` endpoint.

        It is important to note that making a coins request for an account
        without populating the SubAccountIdentifier should not result in the
        coins of all possible SubAccountIdentifiers being returned. Rather,
        it should result in the coins pertaining to no SubAccountIdentifiers
        being returned. To get all coins associated with an account, it may be
        necessary to perform multiple coin requests with unique AccountIdentifiers.

        Optionally, an implementation may choose to support updating an AccountIdentifier's
        unspent coins based on the contents of the mempool. Note, using this functionality
        breaks any guarantee of idempotency.

        parsing the corresponding transaction in the Data API (when it lands on chain)
        will contain a superset of whatever operations were provided during construction.

      summary: Make a Network-Specific Procedure Call 
      description: |
        Call invokes an arbitrary, network-specific procedure call with network-specific
        parameters. The guidance for what this endpoint should or could do is
        purposely left vague. In Ethereum, this could be used to invoke `eth_call`
        to implement an entire Rosetta API interface for some smart contract that
        is not parsed by the implementation creator (like a DEX). This endpoint
        could also be used to provide access to data that does not map
        to any Rosetta models instead of requiring an integrator to use some
        network-specific SDK and call some network-specific endpoint (like surfacing
        staking parameters).

        Call is NOT a replacement for implementing Rosetta API endpoints or mapping
        network-specific data to Rosetta models. Rather, it enables developers to build
        additional Rosetta API interfaces for things they care about without introducing
        complexity into a base-level Rosetta implementation. Simply put, imagine
        that the average integrator will use layered Rosetta API implementations
        that each surfaces unique data.

        If a Rosetta implementation performs some pre-sync before it is
        possible to query blocks, sync_status should be populated so that

        ConstructionPreprocessRequest is passed to the `/construction/preprocess`

        metadata it needs to request for construction.

        Metadata provided in this object should NEVER be a product
        of live data (i.e. the caller must follow some network-specific
        data fetching strategy outside of the Construction API to populate
        required Metadata). If live data is required for construction, it MUST
        be fetched in the call to `/construction/metadata`.

        The caller can provide a max fee they are willing
        to pay for a transaction. This is an array in the case fees
        must be paid in multiple currencies.

        The caller can also provide a suggested fee multiplier
        to indicate that the suggested fee should be scaled.
        This may be used to set higher fees for urgent transactions
        or to pay lower fees when there is less urgency. It is assumed
        that providing a very low multiplier (like 0.0001) will
        never lead to a transaction being created with a fee
        less than the minimum network fee (if applicable).

        In the case that the caller provides both a max fee
        and a suggested fee multiplier, the max fee will set an
        upper bound on the suggested fee (regardless of the
        multiplier provided).

            Integrators may cache the CallResponse if this is set to true

            address is AccountIdentifier.Address. This is used to get all
            transactions related to an AccountIdentifier.Address, regardless
            of SubAccountIdentifier.
          example: "0x1dcc4de8dec75d7aab85b567b6ccd41ad312451b948a7413f0a142fd40d49347"

            success is a synthetic condition populated by parsing network-specific
            operation statuses (using the mapping provided in `/network/options`).
    SearchTransactionsResponse:
      description: |
        SearchTransactionsResponse contains an ordered collection of BlockTransactions
        that match the query in SearchTransactionsRequest. These BlockTransactions
        are sorted from most recent block to oldest block.
      type: object
      required:
        - transactions
        - total_count
      properties:
        transactions:
          type: array
          description: |
            transactions is an array of BlockTransactions sorted by most recent
            BlockIdentifier (meaning that transactions in recent blocks appear
            first).

            If there are many transactions for a particular search, transactions
            may not contain all matching transactions. It is up to the caller to
            paginate these transactions using the max_block field.
          items:
            $ref: '#/components/schemas/BlockTransaction'
        total_count:
          description: |
            total_count is the number of results for a given search. Callers
            typically use this value to concurrently fetch results by offset
            or to display a virtual page number associated with results.

        next_offset:
          description: |
            next_offset is the next offset to use when paginating through
            transaction results. If this field is not populated, there are
            no more transactions to query.
