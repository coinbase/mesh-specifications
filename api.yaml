      description: |
        Get a transaction in a block by its Transaction Identifier. This endpoint
        should only be used when querying a node for a block does not return all
        transactions contained within it.

        All transactions returned by this endpoint must be appended to any
        transactions returned by the /block method by consumers of this data.
        Fetching a transaction by hash is considered an Explorer Method
        (which is classified under the Future Work section).

        Calling this endpoint requires reference to a BlockIdentifier because
        transaction parsing can change depending on which block contains the
        transaction. For example, in Bitcoin it is necessary to know which block
        contains a transaction to determine the destination of fee payments.
        Without specifying a block identifier, the node
        would have to infer which block to use (which could change during a re-org).

        Implementations that require fetching previous transactions to populate
        the response (ex: Previous UTXOs in Bitcoin) may find it useful to run a
        cache within the Rosetta server in the /data directory
        (on a path that does not conflict with the node).

        Get a transaction in the mempool by its Transaction Identifier. This is
        a separate request than fetching a block transaction (/block/transaction)
        because some blockchain nodes need to know that a transaction query is
        for something in the mempool instead of a transaction in a block.

        Transactions may not be fully parsable until they are in a block (ex: may
        not be possible to determine the fee to pay before a transaction is
        executed). On this endpoint, it is ok that returned transactions are
        only estimates of what may actually be included in a block.

        Get an array of all AccountBalances for an AccountIdentifier and the

        must always be returned because some consumers of account balance data need
        to know specifically at which block the balance was calculated to
        compare balances they compute from operations with the balance returned
        by the node.

        It is important to note that making a balance request for an account
        without populating the SubAccountIdentifier should not result in the
        balance of all possible SubAccountIdentifiers being returned. Rather,
        it should result in the balance pertaining to no SubAccountIdentifiers
        being returned (sometimes called the liquid balance). To get all
        balances associated with an account, it may be necessary to
        perform multiple balance requests with unique AccountIdentifiers.

        It is also possible to perform a historical balance lookup (if the server
        supports it) by passing in an optional BlockIdentifier.

        The array of operations provided in transaction construction often times
        can not specify all "effects" of a transaction (consider invoked transactions
        in Ethereum). However, they can deterministically specify the "intent"
        of the transaction, which is sufficient for construction. For this reason,
        parsing the corresponding transaction in the Data API (when it lands on chain)
        will contain a superset of whatever operations were provided during construction.

      description: |
        NetworkStatusResponse contains basic information about the node's
        view of a blockchain network.

        If a Rosetta implementation prunes historical state, it should
