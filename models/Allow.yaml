  Allow specifies supported Operation status, Operation types,
  and all possible error statuses. This Allow object is used by
  clients to validate the correctness of a Rosetta Server implementation. It is
  expected that these clients will error if they receive some response
  that contains any of the above information that is not specified here.
type: object
required:
  - operation_statuses 
  - operation_types
  - errors
  - historical_balance_lookup
properties:
  operation_statuses:
    description: |
      All Operation.Status this implementation supports. Any status
      that is returned during parsing that is not listed here will cause
      client validation to error.
    type: array
    items:
      $ref: 'OperationStatus.yaml'
  operation_types:
    description: |
      All Operation.Type this implementation supports. Any type
      that is returned during parsing that is not listed here will
      cause client validation to error.
    type: array
    items:
      type: string
      example: "TRANSFER"
  errors:
    description: |
      All Errors that this implementation could return. Any error
      that is returned during parsing that is not listed here will
      cause client validation to error.
    type: array
    items:
      $ref: 'Error.yaml'
  historical_balance_lookup:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      Any Rosetta implementation that supports querying the balance
      of an account at any height in the past should set this to true.
