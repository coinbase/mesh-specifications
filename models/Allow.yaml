  Allow specifies supported Operation status, Operation types,
  and all possible error statuses. This Allow object is used by
  clients to validate the correctness of a Rosetta Server implementation. It is
  expected that these clients will error if they receive some response
  that contains any of the above information that is not specified here.
type: object
required:
  - operation_statuses 
  - operation_types
  - errors
  - historical_balance_lookup
  - call_methods
  - balance_exemptions
properties:
  operation_statuses:
    description: |
      All Operation.Status this implementation supports. Any status
      that is returned during parsing that is not listed here will cause
      client validation to error.
    type: array
    items:
      $ref: 'OperationStatus.yaml'
  operation_types:
    description: |
      All Operation.Type this implementation supports. Any type
      that is returned during parsing that is not listed here will
      cause client validation to error.
    type: array
    items:
      type: string
      example: "TRANSFER"
  errors:
    description: |
      All Errors that this implementation could return. Any error
      that is returned during parsing that is not listed here will
      cause client validation to error.
    type: array
    items:
      $ref: 'Error.yaml'
  historical_balance_lookup:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      Any Rosetta implementation that supports querying the balance
      of an account at any height in the past should set this to true.
  timestamp_start_index:
    type: integer
    format: int64
    minimum: 0
    description: |
      If populated, `timestamp_start_index` indicates the first block index
      where block timestamps are considered valid (i.e. all blocks
      less than `timestamp_start_index` could have invalid timestamps).
      This is useful when the genesis block (or blocks) of a network
      have timestamp 0.

      If not populated, block timestamps are assumed to be valid for
      all available blocks.
  call_methods:
    type: array
    description: |
      All methods that are supported by the /call endpoint. Communicating
      which parameters should be provided to /call is the responsibility
      of the implementer (this is en lieu of defining an entire type
      system and requiring the implementer to define that in Allow).
    items:
      type: string
      example: "eth_call"
  balance_exemptions:
    type: array
    description: |
      BalanceExemptions is an array of BalanceExemption indicating
      which account balances could change without a corresponding Operation.

      BalanceExemptions should be used sparingly as they may
      introduce significant complexity for integrators that attempt
      to reconcile all account balance changes.

      If your implementation relies on any BalanceExemptions, you MUST implement
      historical balance lookup (the ability to query an account balance at any
      BlockIdentifier).

      $ref: 'BalanceExemption.yaml'
