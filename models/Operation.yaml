  Operations contain all balance-changing information within a
  transaction. They are always one-sided (only affect 1 AccountIdentifier)
  and can succeed or fail independently from a Transaction.
type: object
required:
  - operation_identifier
  - type
  - status
properties:
  operation_identifier:
    $ref: 'OperationIdentifier.yaml'
  related_operations:
    description: |
      Restrict referenced related_operations to identifier indexes
      < the current operation_identifier.index. This ensures there
      exists a clear DAG-structure of relations.

      Since operations are one-sided, one could imagine relating operations
      in a single transfer or linking operations in a call tree.
    type: array
    items:
      $ref: 'OperationIdentifier.yaml'
    example:
      - index: 1
      - index: 2
  type:
    description: |
      The network-specific type of the operation. Ensure that any type that can be returned here is also
      specified in the NetworkOptionsResponse. This can be very useful to downstream consumers that parse all
      block data.
    type: string
    example: "Transfer"
  status:
    description: |
      The network-specific status of the operation. Status is not defined on the transaction object
      because blockchains with smart contracts may have transactions that partially apply.

      Blockchains with atomic transactions (all operations succeed or all operations fail) will have
      the same status for each operation.
